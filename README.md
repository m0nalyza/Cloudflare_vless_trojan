# Cloudflare-workers/pages proxy script

Support workers deployment, implement vless+ws+tls„ÄÅtrojan+ws+tls„ÄÅvless+ws„ÄÅtrojan+ws proxy node

Support pages deployment, implement vless+ws+tls„ÄÅtrojan+ws+tls proxy node

--------------------------------

## ÔºöCF Vless node can be customized content

#### Can modify Vless_workers_pages file_worker.js file

1.UUID must be customized (line 7)

2. If you cannot access CF websites or ChatGPT, it means that the ProxyIP is invalid. You can replace the ProxyIP and customize it (line 9)

3. The disguised web page is currently left blank and displays the 400 Bad Request interface, which can be customized (line 10)

#### You can also use variable settings in the CF-workers/pages interface. Note: The variable setting results will overwrite the local modification results.
| Variable function | Variable name | Variable value requirements | Variable default value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Necessary uuid | uuid | Comply with uuid specified format | Ten thousand people ride uuid: 77a571fb-4fd2-4b37-8596-1b7d9728bb5c|
| 2. Can access CF websites | proxyip |ipv4 address, domain name, [ipv6 address]|proxyip domain name: cdn.xn--b6gac.eu.org|

----------------------------------

## 2: Customizable content of CF Trojan node

#### The _worker.js file under the Trojan_workers_pages file can be modified

1. The password must be customized (line 4)

2. If you cannot access CF websites or ChatGPT, it means that the ProxyIP is invalid. You can replace the ProxyIP and customize it (line 5)

3. The disguised webpage is currently left blank and displays the 400 Bad Request interface, which can be customized (line 6)

#### You can also use variable settings in the CF-workers/pages interface. Note: The variable setting results will overwrite the local modification results.
| Variable function | Variable name | Variable value requirements | Variable default value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Necessary password | pswd | Any character | Thousands of people riding password: trojan |
| 2. Can access CF websites | proxyip |ipv4 address, domain name, [ipv6 address]|proxyip domain name: cdn.xn--b6gac.eu.org|

----------------------------------
## Three: View related sharing links (single node, non-subscription)
#### CF Vless share link, enter on the webpage: https:// workers domain name or pages domain name or custom domain name/custom uuid
#### CF Trojan share link, enter on the webpage: https:// workers domain name or pages domain name or custom domain name/custom password

#### Notice: 

Because the workers domain name has been blocked by TLS across the entire network, and the pages domain name has been blocked by China Mobile TLS (the proxy client can be immune to blocking by turning on the slicing function)

Therefore, you need to use a custom domain name or be in a proxy environment to view the shared link.

If you watch the tutorial, you can create countless preferred IP nodes without buying domain names or sharing links.

When the client does not support the slicing function, it is recommended to use a TLS-enabled node or a custom domain node for the worker domain name node.
